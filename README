To run, cd into cli_tool, then run 'python cli.py {input}'

Progress.

Today I scrapped together a main.py to get a Flask server running and get the Authentication working.

So I currently have a auth_token working.
access_token line 63 of main.py

To run it, I cd into cli_tool.
Then run python core/main.py
This opens the Grant Access web page

Then after granting access, I return the access token


The problems I face at the moment...

1 I need to figure out how to get this logic back into my original flow.
Ideally when you start the program, this code runs.

2 I need to get access_token into my cli.py flow. I can possibly save it as an
env variable. Then all the different branches of logic would just make a API 
call to //api.spotify.com/..., and use the Access token as the Authenication
Bearer token.

I think I to first figure out this flow. I believe once I have the access_token
where I need it, and the flow of the program working well, then I will
just need to update my search and current logic to make the relavent requests.

eg Pause just needs to call 
"https://api.spotify.com/v1/me/player/pause"
with the Header
'Authorization': f"Bearer {ENV.access_token}"

or whatever this will look like. 


I feel like I am so close now. All the API endpoints exist already, I just
need to position my code to be able to call these.


So tomorrow, focus on (in order):
- App setup. Starting app will call main, then anything else will occur in terminal with cli.py
- Getting access_token into envs (for now. Probably not safe or anything, but will work for now)
- Plugging in Spotify APIS.
